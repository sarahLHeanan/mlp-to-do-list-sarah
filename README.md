## Sarah's Notes

Please run the application as follows
- Up Laravel Sail (or environment of your choice)
- Migrate and seed the database: `sail artisan migrate:fresh --seed`
- If using Sail, application will be available at http://localhost:8000/tasks
- Use the form to create, complete and delete tasks. The view should be responsive.
- Tasks should disappear if completed or deleted and a flash message should appear at the top of the screen
- Run unit test by executing `sail test`
